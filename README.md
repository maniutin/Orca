# Orca

## An easy-to-use music production app with a focus on collaboration.

### This app allows users to create short loops using built-in drum machine, synthesizer and bass synthesizer. Then, other users can contribute to the tracks and the original user can either accept or reject the changes. Once the changes have been accepted, the new track will appear in the list of tracks.

### Orca was created as the final project for Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.
